Copacetic is a simple POST-only ajax lib.It is implemented as a closure, which calls a child program
after connecting and receiving.

REQUIRES: json2.js from https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js

USAGE: COPACETIC.connect("remote host", "args", CHILD.function)

Example:

document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded",
    function () {
        COPACETIC.connect("toss.cgi", "foo=bar", CHILD.blab);
    }, true);

This is a SUPER-BASIC library. It has been tested pretty well in production, but there are others out 
there that are much more comprehensive. On the other hand, it's small! On the gripping hand, it has 
a cool name.
